<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Fearless Steps Initiative by UTDallas-CRSS led to the digitization, recovery, and diarization of 19,000 hours of original analog audio data, as well as the development of algorithms to extract meaningful information from this multichannel naturalistic data resource. As an initial step to motivate a stream-lined and collaborative effort from the speech and language community, UTDallas-CRSS is hosting a series of progressively complex tasks to promote advanced research on naturalistic “Big Data” corpora. This began with <a href="https://www.interspeech2019.org/posts/one-giant-leap-for-mankind/">ISCA INTERSPEECH-2019</a>: "The FEARLESS STEPS Challenge: Massive Naturalistic Audio (FS-#1)". This first edition of this challenge encouraged the development of core unsupervised/semi-supervised speech and language systems for single-channel data with low resource availability, serving as the “First Step” towards extracting high-level information from such massive unlabeled corpora.</p>



<p>As a natural progression following the successful <a href="http://fearlesssteps.exploreapollo.org/">Inaugural Challenge FS#1</a>, the <a href="https://fearless-steps.github.io/ChallengePhase2/">FEARLESS STEPS Challenge Phase-#2</a> focuses on the development of single-channel supervised learning strategies. This FS#2 provides 80 hours of ground-truth data through Training and Development sets, with an additional 20 hours of blind-set Evaluation data. Based on feedback from the Fearless Steps participants, additional Tracks for streamlined speech recognition and speaker diarization have been included in the FS#2. The results for this Challenge will be presented at the ISCA INTERSPEECH-2020 Special Session. We encourage participants to explore any and all research tasks of interest with the Fearless Steps Corpus – with suggested Task Domains listed below. Research participants can, however, also utilize the FS#2 corpus to explore additional problems dealing with naturalistic data, which we welcome as part of the special session.</p>

<h2>FS-02 Challenge Data</h2>
<img src="images/Stages.png" alt="Stages of the Mission" id="fsc" >
 						<p style="font-size: 14px;text-align: center;">Figure shows the Stages of the Mission</p><br>
  						<p>The Stages 1, 5 and 6 were high impact mission-critical events which is ideal for the development of the 100-hour Challenge Corpus. With the quality of speech data varying between  0 and 20 dB SNR in this challenge corpus, the channel variability and complex interactions across all five channels of interest are mostly encapsulated in these 100 hours. The multichannel data are chosen from the major events given below:</p>
  						<ul>
  								<li> Lift Off (25 hours)</li><br>
								<li> Lunar Landing (50 hours)</li><br>
								<li> Lunar Walking (25 hours)</li><br>
						</ul>
						<p>These landmark events have been found to possess rich information from the speech and language perspective.five channels out of the 29 channels were picked since it had the the most activity over the selected events. </p>
						<ul>
  								<li> Flight Director (FD) </li><br>
								<li> Mission Operations Control Room (MOCR)</li><br>
								<li> Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC)</li><br>
								<li> Network Controller (NTWK) </li><br>
								<li> Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager (EECOM) </li><br>
						</ul>
						<p>The personnel operating these five channels (channel owners/primary speakers) were in command of the most critical aspects of the mission, with additional backroom staff looping in for interactions with the primary owners of this channel.</p><br>
						<img src="images/DT1.png" alt="Table 1 the shows distribution of total speech content" id="fsc"><br>
						<p>The distribution of total speech content in each of the channels for every event has been given in the table above. Total speech content in the challenge corpus amounts to approximately 36 hours.</p>
<p>To make sure there is an equitable distribution of data into training, evaluation, and development sets for the challenge tasks, we have categorized the data based on noise levels, amount of speech content, and amount of silence. Due to the long silence durations, and based on importance of the mission, the speech activity density of the corpus varies throughout the mission.</p>
						<img src="images/DT2.png" alt="Table 2 shows the Signal to Noise Ratio Statistics per channel for Dev Data" id="fsc"><br>
						<p>The above table above is a general analysis of the Challenge data. Even though the Researchers are not provided with the channel information of Train, Test and Dev Sets, they may be able to make inferences by computing SNR’s for each file.</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p>The Fearless Steps corpus is derived fom a five-year NSF CISE funded project awarded to CRSS at the University of Texas at Dallas. UTDallas-CRSS established the hardware/software solutions to digitize and diarize 19,000 hrs of NASA Apollo data. All core Apollo data released as part of this challenge has been approved for public release by NASA Export Control. The full audio corpus is also available through UTDallas-CRSS. Any reference to or listing of organizations other than UTD is for information only; it does not imply recommendation or endorsement by UTDallas-CRSS nor does it imply that the products mentioned are necessarily the best available for that purpose. </p>

<br><strong>Note:</strong>The Creative Commons License is restricted to the efforts made by CRSS-UTD, which involves 100 hours of Challenge Corpus (audio) data sampled from 8Khz, along with its meta-data generated separately.
