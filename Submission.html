<h2>Submission Rules</h2>
<p><ol>

<li> Registered Participants can choose to make multiple submissions in any one or more tasks from the Fearless Steps challenge. 
   Participants not registered, but a part of the registered participants' team can also submit their system results.
   Submissions by researchers who did not register for the challenge and are not a part of any registered teams will not 
   be considered for the Challenge.</li><br>

<li> Submissions will only be accepted as long as they follow the format provided below and in the example submission packet.
   Every submission must abide by the following rules:<br>

    <li> The email must contain one or more attachments of one or more submission packets, each in a compressed format.<br>
        (REFER: Example submission packet provided with the FS02_Scoring_Toolkit: 
            <a href="https://github.com/AJoGaTech/FS02_Scoring_Toolkit">FS02_Scoring_Toolkit</a></li><br>
    
    <li>A single compressed (.zip or .tar.gz) submission packet should contain 3 main items:<br><br>
        <ul>
        <li> System Description Document (.pdf file)</li><br>
        
        <li> Dev (folder containing system outputs)</li><br>
        
        <li> Eval (folder containing system outputs)</li><br>    
        </ul>
    (REFER: "FS02_System_Description_eg.pdf" provided in the submission packet
        to understand the contents the 3 items must include)</li><br>
   </ul></li>
    <li> Every submission packet should have the following File Naming convention:<br>
        
        &lt;email-id&gt;_&lt;task-name&gt;_Submission_&lt;system-number&gt;.&lt;extn&gt;<br>
           (REFER: "crss@utdallas.edu_ASR_track2_Submission_1.tar.gz" provided as an illustration

<div class="article" id="Evaluation">
<h2>Evaluation Rules</h2>
<p><ol>

<li> Both Dev and Eval system submissions will be scored. Only Eval set results will be considered 
   to rank teams for each Challenge. </li><br>

<li> Results for each system submission will be sent privately to respective participants on May 7th.
   For every team, only the 5 best performing system submissions per task will be considered for the ranking.</li><br>

<li> Evaluation code available at <a href="https://github.com/AJoGaTech/FS02_Scoring_Toolkit">FS02_Scoring_Toolkit</a> will be used to score 
   all systems. Participants are expected to test their system output files using the Dev set
   ground truth labels to ensure proper formatting of all system outputs prior to submission.</li><br>

<li> Participants will be notified of their rankings on May 7, 2020 before 11.59pm AOE, which they can report 
   on their conference paper(s). The best performing systems will be displayed on the FS02 website 
   leaderboard under each team-name and system-number (&lt;team-name&gt;_system_&lt;system-number&gt;)<br>
   (REFER: <a href="https://fearless-steps.github.io/ChallengePhase2/Final.html">to this page</a> )</li><br>

<li> All Challenge participants are required to submit a conference paper(s) describing their systems 
   (and reporting performance on Dev and Eval sets) to the "FEARLESS STEPS CHALLENGE PHASE-2" 
   Special Sessions section at ISCA INTERSPEECH-2020. (Deadline: May 8, 2020)</li><br>

<h2>System Description Document</h2>
<p>
This document serves as an example system description document, which is being used to
provide details regarding the Submission Packet for the Fearless Steps Challenge Phase-02.
Contents of the Submission Packet:</p>
<p><ol>
<li> System Description Document: A document describing the system should be included as
a .pdf file in the base submission packet directory (same location as in the example
submission packet provided). More details on the description provided in FS01 Eval Plan
- Appendix D. Participants can also send their Interspeech paper drafts as a System
Description Document (this document will not be shared by the FS Team to anyone at
any time). If participants are sending multiple submissions for the same task based on
the system described in the paper, the same document can be used in multiple
submission packets.</li><br>

<li> Dev and Eval : Participants are required to send their system output results on both the
Dev and Eval sets for a given task. The Dev folder should only include system output
results for a given challenge task on the Dev set provided for that task. The Eval folder
should only include system output results for a given challenge task on the Eval set
provided for that task. All system output files should have the same filename (with
different extension) as its corresponding audio stream file for tasks using audio streams
(SAD, SD_track_1, SD_track2, and ASR_track1). For tasks using audio segments
(SID, ASR_track2). For correct formatting examples, please refer to the ./egs/ directory
of the FS02 Scoring Toolkit. Additionally, details regarding the system output files are
also provided by running the shell scripts in ./scripts/ with no input arguments.<br>
The following number of files will be expected in both folders (per task):<br>
<ul>
<li> Speech Activity Detection (SAD): All the files should have the .txt extension
and must follow the format provided in the FS01 Eval Plan Appendix A.3.<br>
i. Dev: 30 files, titled FS02_dev_001.txt … to … FS02_dev_030.txt<br>
ii. Eval: 40 files, titled FS02_eval_001.txt … to … FS02_eval_040.txt</li><br>

<li> Speaker Diarization (SD_track1, SD_track2): Both tracks will have the same
submission format. All the files should have the .rttm extension and must follow
the format provided in the above mentioned Eval Plan, Appendix A.1.<br>
i. Dev: 30 files, titled FS02_dev_001.rttm … to … FS02_dev_030.rttm<br>
ii. Eval: 40 files, titled FS02_eval_001.rttm … to … FS02_eval_040.rttm</li><br>

<li> Speaker Identification (SID): The 2 files should have the .txt extension and
must follow the format provided in the FS01 Eval Plan Appendix A.4.<br>
i. Dev: 1 file, titled FS02_SID_uttID2spkID_Dev.txt which contains 6373 SID
utterance IDs with their 5 system predictions.<br>
ii. Eval: 40 files, titled FS02_SID_uttID2spkID_Eval.txt which contains 8466
SID utterance IDs with their 5 system predictions.</li><br>

<li> Automatic Speech Recognition Track-1 (ASR_track1): All the files should
have the .json extension and must follow the format provided in the FS01 Eval
Plan Appendix A.2. All .json files must have the respective fields in every
object/struct: “words”, “startTime”, and “endTime”.<br>
i. Dev: 30 files, titled FS02_dev_001.json … to … FS02_dev_030.json<br>
ii. Eval: 40 files, titled FS02_eval_001.json … to … FS02_eval_040.json</li><br>

<li> Speaker Identification (SID): The 2 files should have the NO file extension and
must follow the format provided by Kaldi, describes in the “text” section of the
<a href="https://kaldi-asr.org/doc/data_prep.html#data_prep_data">Kaldi Data Prep page.</a><br>
i. Dev: 1 file, titled FS02_ASR_track2_transcriptions_Dev which contains
9203 utterance IDs with their corresponding transcriptions.<br>
ii. Eval: 40 files, titled FS02_ASR_track2_transcriptions_Eval which contains
13714 utterance IDs with their corresponding transcriptions.</li><br>
</ul></li>
</ol><br>
Additional details regarding the Evaluation and Submission Rules are provided to participants in
a separate document. Please feel free to reach out to FearlessSteps@utdallas.edu for any
